# Trying to make an app to get the weather of a user's location
* First commit was mostly a set up of the server with few codes
* Second commit gets the user coordinates and displays the latitude and longitude
* The third commit:
 - adds a post request on the server
 - sets it up on the client side
 - Get the data of the POST request and returns it
# Create local db
* install nedb 
* create data base and auto save user data to it.
